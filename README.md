# README-Generator

## Purpose
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Task

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

Your task is to write a program that quickly and easily creates a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The application will be invoked by using the following command: Node index.js

## Built With
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js
